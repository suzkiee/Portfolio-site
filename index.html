        <p class="relative"> I'm from New Jersey! I came to Boston for school and studied human services! I graduated <a href="https://slogatnu.com/2017/05/10/congratulations-2016-2017-community-service-leadership-award-recipients/">Northeastern University</a> in 2016 and
            became a <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/3NDdniijyPY7C/">Massachusetts Promise Fellow </a> in 2017.

        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
        <p>
            I see all my work experiences as an examples of my crafting. I've written curriculum, optimized physical workspaces and even party planning. It's thrilling to create things not just with my own hands but by collaborating with my different communities,
            knowledge spheres and interests.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <p>
            Now, I work at Upstatement as the Studio Experience Manager because I'm really curious about design and code. This site is my very first pass at HTML, CSS and Javascript!
